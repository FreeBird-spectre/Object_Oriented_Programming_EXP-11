Experiment: Classes and Objects in C++

üéØ Aim

To study and implement classes and objects in C++ for solving real-world problems such as:

Representing cars with attributes.

Calculating area of a rectangle.

Storing and displaying student details.

Calculating volume of cube and cuboid.

üìú Introduction

A class in C++ is a user-defined data type that binds data (attributes) and functions (methods) together.
Objects are instances of a class, representing real-world entities such as cars, students, or geometric shapes.

Using classes helps in organizing code, improving reusability, and applying object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation and abstraction.

üõ†Ô∏è Programs Implemented

1Ô∏è‚É£ Car Class

Description:
Represents details of a car such as brand, model, type, year, and top speed.

Logic:

Define a Car class with attributes.

Create objects (c1, c2) and assign values.

Display details using cout.

Algorithm:

Define class with attributes.

Create object of Car.

Assign values.

Print details.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Rectangle Area Program

Description:

Takes length and width of a rectangle and calculates its area.

Logic:

Define a Rectangle class with attributes length, width.

Use method area() to compute area.

Input values from user and display result.

Algorithm:

Read length and width.

Compute area = length √ó width.

Display result.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Student Class

Description:

Stores and displays student information like name, branch, subjects, and occupations.

Logic:

Define a Student class with multiple string attributes.

Create two objects with different values.

Display stored details.

Algorithm:

Define class with string attributes.

Create objects s1, s2.

Assign values to attributes.

Display details using cout.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Cube Volume Program

Description:

Calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.

Logic:

Define a Cube class with private attributes.

Take side as input.

Method calculateVolume() computes side¬≥.

Method output() displays result.

Algorithm:

Input side of cube.

Compute volume = side¬≥.

Print volume.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Cuboid Volume Program

Description:

Calculates the volume of a cuboid using length, breadth, and height.

Logic:

Define a Cuboid class with attributes.

Take input values from user.

Method Volume() computes length √ó breadth √ó height.

Display result using Output().

Algorithm:

Input length, breadth, height.

Compute volume = l √ó b √ó h.

Print result.

How to define and use classes and objects in C++.

Use of methods inside classes for calculations.

Handling real-world examples like cars, students, and shapes.

Use of encapsulation (cube class with private data).

Application of basic OOP concepts in C++.
